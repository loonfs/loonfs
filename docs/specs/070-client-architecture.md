# Spec 070: client architecture

## First milestone

The first client milestone is a full live mirror, not File Provider hydration.

Why:
the mirror client exercises the core sync semantics with fewer platform-specific variables.

## Client shape

- Rust daemon
- CLI
- later macOS File Provider bridge
- local SQLite state is acceptable

## Local durable truth

The client uses SQLite as its only durable local truth.

The first client-state slice models three durable views explicitly:

- `remote_state`: what remote metadata the client has observed
- `local_state`: what local filesystem state the client has observed
- `sync_anchor`: the last fully reconciled state

Why this shape exists:

- conflict decisions should compare explicit durable views, not reconstructed guesses
- restart behavior should be deterministic
- later File Provider mode should reuse the same truth model

Failure modes prevented:

- planner behavior changing after restart because one view was only in memory
- conflict handling depending on callback ordering instead of durable observed state

## First SQLite schema

The first schema version is intentionally small but durable enough to support one hot-file planner loop.

It must contain at least these tables or equivalent structures:

- `remote_state`
- `local_state`
- `sync_anchor`
- `planned_actions`
- `transfer_ledger`
- `conflicts_and_errors`

The first schema uses SQLite `user_version = 1`.

For the first slice, rows for already-known mirrored files are keyed by:

```text
(namespace_id, inode_id)
```

Rules:

- `namespace_id` is the namespace-scoped durable identity root
- `inode_id` is the canonical file identity whenever the client already knows the remote inode
- `display_name` and `parent_inode_id` are observed views, not canonical identity
- local-only creations that do not yet have a server inode are deferred to a later schema extension

The first table contents are:

- `remote_state`: latest observed `seq`, `revision_no`, content digest, and current observed path view
- `local_state`: latest observed local content digest, current observed path view, `dirty`, and local observation time
- `sync_anchor`: last fully synced remote revision and content digest
- `planned_actions`: the current planner output for one `(namespace_id, inode_id)` when work is needed
- `transfer_ledger`: resumable transfer progress keyed to namespace file identity
- `conflicts_and_errors`: durable user-visible explanations

Why the first schema is inode-keyed:

- canonical metadata is inode-keyed everywhere else in the system
- path-only local truth would reintroduce identity ambiguity during rename races

Failure modes prevented:

- the client forgetting whether two observed paths refer to the same canonical file
- local restart logic inventing sync identity from a mutable path string

## Planner transaction boundary

One planner pass for one mirrored file must happen inside one SQLite transaction.

The first planner transaction does all of the following atomically:

1. read `remote_state`, `local_state`, and `sync_anchor` for one `(namespace_id, inode_id)`
2. derive one deterministic planner decision
3. replace or clear the current `planned_actions` row for that same file identity

The planner may still perform uploads and downloads outside SQLite, but the decision about what should happen next must not be split across callbacks or partially persisted writes.

Why this rule exists:

- the planner should never observe one durable view and persist a decision against another
- restart behavior should be replayable from SQLite alone

Failure modes prevented:

- crash windows where the planner read new local state but persisted an action against stale remote state
- in-memory planner branches that cannot be reconstructed after restart

## First hot-file decision skeleton

The first deterministic planner rule compares the three durable views for one known mirrored file:

- if local observed state differs from the sync anchor while remote still matches the sync anchor, plan `upload_local_edit`
- if remote observed state differs from the sync anchor while local still matches the sync anchor, plan `download_remote_edit`
- if both local and remote differ from the sync anchor, plan `create_conflict_copy`
- if both still match the sync anchor, clear any pending action and return `no_op`

This first rule is intentionally narrow. It is enough to prove that restart-safe planner state can drive one hot-file case before the client grows broader sync semantics.

## Local data model inspiration

The client should keep separate, individually consistent views of:

- remote observed state
- local observed state
- last fully synced state

Why it exists:
conflict reasoning and convergence are much easier when directionality is explicit.

## Client responsibilities

- watch local changes
- poll or subscribe to remote changes
- plan sync work deterministically
- persist enough local state to recover after restart
- avoid publishing partial local observations as canonical truth

## Later File Provider rule

Online-only placeholders must use the same canonical inode and revision semantics as full mirror mode.
The platform integration layer must not invent a different sync model.
